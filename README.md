## Project Overview

This project is an exploration of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It was built with a guide as mentioned above. We learned the essentials, and then added some of our own features, like mutations. We also created a bunch of assets to use in the game, such as maps, characters, and "evolisks". We created our own story, and designed the progression. Enjoy the amazing world of "Evoltama"!
